The Heat Bugs example is a Repast translation of the Swarm toolkit example
application Heat Bugs. The simulation can be run on Windows by running 
the bugs.bat batch file from within the bugs directory. You should
also be able to run Heat Bugs by double clicking on the bugs.jar.

To run Heat Bugs on unix run the bugs.sh script. (This assumes java is
in your path).

The source code to this model can be found in 
repast/src/uchicago/src/sim/heatBugs.
