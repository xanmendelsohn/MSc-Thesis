RasterBugs is simple demo of "bugs" moving around a space defined by a
GIS raster file. It is intended to demonstrate how to work with the
RasterSpace space object.The simulation can be run on Windows by
running the rasterBugs.bat batch file from within the rasterBugs
directory or by double clicking on the rasterbugs.jar file. If using
Unix, use the rasterBugs.sh script.

The raster file is called sample.txt and can be found in the source
directory.
