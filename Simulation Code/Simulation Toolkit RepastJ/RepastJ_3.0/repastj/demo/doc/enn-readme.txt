A partial implementation of Randal Picker's Endogenous Neighborhood
game as described in his as yet unpublished "Endogenous Neighborhoods and
Norms." This simulation extends prior work by Randal Picker. See "Simple
Games in a Complex World: A Generative Approach to the Adoption of Norms",
64 University of Chicago Law Review 1225 (1997). Thanks to Randal Picker
for allowing us to include this with Repast.

This example is intended to illustrate how to write a cooperation game type 
simulation using Repast. The simulation can be run on Windows by running the 
enn.bat from within the enn directory. You can also run a batch 
version of the enn model using the ennBatch.bat scripts. 

If using Unix use the enn.sh, or ennBatch.sh. 

The source code to this model can be found in 
repast/src/uchicago/src/sim/enn.
