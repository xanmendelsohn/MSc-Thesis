This example is a partial implementation of the Sugar Scape simulation from 
_Growing Artificial Societies_ by Epstein, Joshua M. and Axtell, Robert, 
only implementing rules G, R, and M from chapter II. The source code, 
SugarModel.java, has been heavily annotated
and should provide a good example of how to use Repast to write a
simulation. 

The simulation will write its graph data out to the
graph_data.txt file and other data to sugar_data.txt file.

The simulation can be run on Windows by running the sscape.bat
batch file from within the sscape directory or by double clicking on
the sscape.jar file. If using Unix, use the sscape.sh script.

The source for this simulation can be found in 
repast/src/uchicago/src/sim/sugarScape
