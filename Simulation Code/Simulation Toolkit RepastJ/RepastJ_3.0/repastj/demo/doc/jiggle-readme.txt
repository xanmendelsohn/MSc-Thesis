 Jiggle is a simple example simulation demonstrating how to create network 
type models out of nodes and links using Repast. Clicking load from
file on the parameters tab will load the network from jiggle.dl. Jiggle 
also records the evolved network in the jiggle_matrix.dl file.

See the Jiggle API docs for more information.

The simulation can be run on Windows by running the jiggle.bat batch file from 
within the hyper directory, or double clicking on the jiggle.jar
file.  If using Unix, use jiggle.sh

The source code to this model can be found in
