HexaBugs is a version of Heat Bugs "played" on a hexagonal
torus. Other than that it is identical to Heat Bugs. The simulation
can be run on Windows by running the hexaBugs.bat batch file from
within the hexaBugs directory or by double clicking on the
hexabugs.jar file. If using Unix, use the hexaBugs.sh script.
