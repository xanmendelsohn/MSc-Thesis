This is an implementation of the simulation 
described in John Padgett's "The Emergence of Simple Ecologies of Skill: 
A Hypercycle Approach to Economic Organization" in _The Economy as an Evolving
Complex System II_, Eds. Arthur, Durlauf, and Lane. SFI
Studies in the Sciences of Complexity, Vol. XXVII, Addison-Wesley, 1997,
pp. 199-221. Thanks to John Padgett for allowing us to include it here.
jpadgett@midway.uchicago.edu. This example illustrates how to write a simple 
network in a grid type model. 

The simulation can be run on Windows by running the hyper.bat batch file from 
within the hyper directory, or by double clicking on the hyper.jar
file. Under unix run the hyper.sh script.

The source code to this model can be found in
