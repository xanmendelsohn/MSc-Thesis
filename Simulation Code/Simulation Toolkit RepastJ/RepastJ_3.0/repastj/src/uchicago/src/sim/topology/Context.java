/**
 * This is an interface for a set of agents who all participate in the same
 * collection of relationships {@link RelationTopology}.  So this interface serves two purposes:
 * 1) It is a collection of agents, and 2) it acts as a mediator for
 * one or more semantically connected relationships.
 *
 * Towards the first purpose, this is implemented as a set.  Meaning, an object
 * should only exist in this collection once.  It can participate in as many
 * relationships as you want, however.
 *
 * Towards the second purpose, the relationships that are contained by this
 * Context should be related (and possibly affect one another).  So, for example,
 * it would make sense to have several space relationships and a network relationship
 * that is affected by spatial distance included in on Context, but it wouldn't
 * necessarily make sense to have a boss-employee relationship in the same Context
 * as a residential neighborhood relationship.  But fundamentally, this is up to the
 * modeller.
