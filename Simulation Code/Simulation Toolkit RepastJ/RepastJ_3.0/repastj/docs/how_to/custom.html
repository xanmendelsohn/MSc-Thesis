<h1>
<center>How to Create Custom Actions</center>
</h1><p>
Custom actions are actions that occur in response to the movement of a slider, the
click of a button or the toggling of a checkbox on the Custom Action tab in
the settings windows. This document explains how to create such actions and should
be used in conjunction with the demonstration source code to the 
Heat Bugs model, and the Hypercycles model.<p>

The creation of custom actions is coordinated by the
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/ModelManipulator.html">Model
Manipulator</a> class. SimModelImpl contains a ModelManipulator as a
protected instance variable, and it is thus available to all classes
that extend SimModelImpl (that is, all Repast models). ModelManipulator
contains three methods for creating custom actions:
<code><pre>
public void addSlider(String label, int min, int max, int tickInterval, 
       SliderListener listener)
public void addButton(String label, ActionListener listener)
public void addCheckBox(String label, CheckBoxListener listener, boolean isSelected)
</pre></code>
If you want to add a slider, you use addSlider, a button, addButton, and a checkbox,
addCheckBox. The arguments to these three methods are defined in
greater detail in the API documentation for 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/engine/ModelManipulator.html">Model
Manipulator</a>. In all these cases however, the listener argument specifies
what action should be taken when the slider is moved, the button is clicked, or
the checkbox is toggled. These listener classes are abstract 
classes (SliderListener, CheckBoxListener) or interfaces (ActionListener) 
that are extended or implemented by the modeler to perform the 
appropriate action.<p>

<h3>Slider Listener</h3>
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/event/SliderListener.html">Slider Listener</a>
is an abstract class that a user will extend to specify the appropriate
action to take when the slider is moved. A modeler must implement a SliderListener's
<tt>public void execute()</tt> method. This method is called whenever
the slider is moved. There are three variables that are available from within
this method:
<ul><li><b>value</b> an <tt>int</tt> which is the current value of the slider</li>
<li><b>isAdjusting</b> a <tt>boolean</tt> which indicates whether the slider 
is in the process of being moved</li> 
<li><b>isSlidingLeft</b> a <tt>boolean</tt> which indicates whether the
slider is being dragged to the left</li>
</ul>. 

A Slider is then created as follows:
<code><pre>
class Incrementer extends SliderListener {
  public void execute() {
    if (isSlidingLeft) {
      someValue -= value;
    } else {
      someValue += value;
    }
  }
};

modelManipulator.addSlider("Increment", 0, 100, 10, new Incrementer());
</pre></code>
(This could also be done more concisely as a anonymous inner class.)
Here a new class Incrementer that extends SliderListener is defined. Its
execute method will subtract the current value of the slider from <tt>someValue</tt>
if the slider is moving left, or add the current value of the slider to 
<tt>someValue</tt> if the slider is moving right. The <tt>modelManipulator.addSlider</tt>
method associates this behavoir with a slider. The slider will be
labeled "Increment" and range for 0 to 100 with labeled ticks every 10 units.
<p>
<h3>ActionListener</h3>
The
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/ActionListener.html">ActionListener</a> 
interface is provided as part Java itself.
It has a single method: <tt>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)</tt> 
and is used in much the same way as the SliderListener. The modeler
must provide an implementation of an ActionListener, implementing
the <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method. Whenever the button is clicked
the actionPerformed method will be called, and so it is in this method that
the modeler should code the appropriate actions. For example,
<code><pre>
modelManipulator.addButton("Clear Space", new ActionListener() {
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
    space.clear();
  }
});
</pre></code>
(Here the ActionListener is coded as an anonymous inner class.) The
ModelManipulator creates a button labeled "Clear Space" and the 
actionPerformed method will be executed whenever that button is clicked.
<p>

<h3>CheckBoxListener</h3>
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/event/CheckBoxListener.html">CheckBoxListener</a>
is an abstract class that a user will extend to specify the appropriate
action to take when a checkbox is clicked. Like the SliderListener, a modeler
must extend this class and implement its <tt>public void execute()</tt>
method. This method is called whenever the checkbox is clicked. Two variables
are available from within this method: 
<ul>
<li><b>isSelected</b> a <tt>boolean</tt> indicating 
whether the checkbox is selected or not</li> 
<li><b>actionEvent</b> an <tt>ActionEvent</tt> which should not be of interest to most users.
See the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/awt/event/ActionEvent.html">ActionEvent</a> 
entry in the jdk javadocs for more on ActionEvents.</li>
</ul>
A checkbox is then created as follows:
<code><pre>
CheckBoxListener showVal = new CheckBoxListener() {
  public void execute() {
    if (isSelected) {
      showValues();
    } else {
      hideValues();
    }
  }
};

modelManipulator.addCheckBox("Show Values", showVal, false);
</pre></code>
Here when the checkbox is clicked the execute
method will be called. This method then checks whether the
checkbox is selected through the isSelected variable and calls
showValues() or hideValues(). ModelManipulator then creates a checkbox labeled
"Show Values", associates it with the <tt>showVal</tt>
CheckBoxListener and sets its initial state to unselected.<p>

<h3>The Model Manipulator</h3>
As mentioned above all models that extend SimModelImpl have
acces to a ModelManipulator variable called modelManipulator. If 
you wish to have custom actions in your own simulations, you can
use this modelManipulator. The easiest way to setup a model that 
will create and show the sliders etc. created via a ModelManipulator is
to put all the slider etc. creation in a private method in your model, and
call this method as part of your model's setup() method. <b>Note that
the first thing you want to call in this method is 
<tt>modelManipulator.init()</tt></b> The Heat Bugs and
HyperCycles demonstration simulations both setup their custom actions in 
this way, and can be used as templates for your own custom action
setup.
