<b>The Random Class</b><br>
The Random class (uchicago.src.sim.util.Random) provides
default random number generation for Repast. Random 
encapsulates the <a href="http://tilde-hoschek.home.cern.ch/~hoschek/colt/V1.0.2/doc/index.html">colt</a> library's 
random number generation by consolidating all the random number
distributions provided by the colt library into a single class. These
distributions are wrapped as static instance variables.
The intent here is two-fold: provide easier access
to these distributions and more importantly to insure that each
distribution uses the same random number stream, allowing for easily
repeatable behavoir of random number generation.<p>
 
Random contains a variety of random number distributions as static
instance variables as well as a few next* methods for returning the
next psuedo-random value from a distribution. Before using any of the
instance variable distributions, these distributions must be created via
the appropriate create* method. For example,
<code><pre>
// initialize Random.uniform
Random.createUniform();

// Random.uniform is now initialized and can be used.
int index = Random.uniform.getNextIntFromTo(0, 100);
</pre></code>
This creates a uniform distribution from which to draw random numbers.
You can then draw random numbers from this distribution using
the the appropriate methods. See the cern.jet.random package in the
<a href="../colt/index.html">colt</a> documentation for the details
of these methods. The actual random number generator is seeded on 
first use with the current timestamp. See below for more details on 
seeding the generator.<p>

Once created a distribution can be used anywhere in your code through the
use of Random's static instance variables. So for example, if you create
the Uniform distribution in your model's begin() method, you can access the
same Uniform distribution in your model's agent code with
<code>Random.uniform</code>. This instance variable should always be
referenced as such, that is, as Random._distribution_name_, and not as
the right hand side of an assignment. Assigning a variable in this way
can lead to unpredictable results when setting the random seed. 
In short, code like this:
<code><pre>
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
</pre></code>
and <b>never like this</b>:
<code><pre>
Uniform myUniform = Random.uniform; <b>// This is dangerous. Don't do it!!!</b>
...
int index = myUniform.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
</pre></code>

All but one of the distributions in Random are from the 
colt library. The instance variable name is the same as 
the corresponding colt object with the first
character in lower case. For example, the cern.jet.Random.Zeta distribution 
is Random.zeta. See the cern.jet.random package in the
<a href="../colt/index.html">colt</a> library documentation
for more information about these distributions, and how to 
draw random numbers from them.

The next* methods can be used as is, without creating a distribution
before hand. For example,
<code><pre>
double s = Random.nextCauchy();
</pre></code>
Draws the next value from a Cauchy distribution.<p>

In all cases, the distributions use a MersenneTwister as the
source for psuedo-random numbers. The MersenneTwister is a
particularly good generator for simulations as it has an
extremely large period. This generator is seeded on first use
with the current timestamp. However, Random also allows you to set and 
get the random seed as well as the random number generator associated 
with that seed. Setting a new seed with <code>Random.setSeed</code> 
will create a new MersenneTwister with the specified seed and 
<b>invalidate</b> any previously created distributions. If you wish to use
a distribution after the seed has been set, you must create it as
described above. Consequently, the following is correct code:
<code><pre>
Random.createUniform();
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10);
...
Random.setSeed(1L);
Random.createUniform();
...
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10);
</pre></code>
but this is <b>not</b>:
<code><pre>
Random.createUniform();
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10);
...
Random.setSeed(1L);
...
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(1, 10); <b>// This won't work</b>
</pre></code>

Calling a Repast model's setRngSeed method will also set Random's seed,
as will setting the seed through the parameter's panel of a gui model.
Once the seed has been set all the distributions will
use the same random number stream and repeatable randomness can be 
easily achieved.<p>

Note that Random creates a default random number generator using the
current timestamp as the seed. If you do not explicitly set your own seed,
the distributions created via the create* calls will use this default
generator.<p>

The normal pattern of use then is to create the distributions you want,
and having done so draw randon numbers from those distributions
througout your code via Random's instance variables. For
example:
<code><pre>
Random.createUniform();
Random.createNormal(.5, .3);
...
int index = Random.uniform.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
double val = Random.normal.nextDouble();
</pre></code>

<a name="custom">
<b>Custom Random Number Generation</b><br>
Custom random number generation still uses the colt library but
bypasses Repast's Random class. You'll need to do this if you
want to use distributions with independent random number streams (random
number generators). The general idea here is to define some
instance variables in your model of the appropriate distribution
types, create your random number generators and then associate these
generators with the distributions you want to use. For example:
<code><pre>
import cern.jet.random.*;
import cern.jet.random.engine.MersenneTwister;
...

public class MyModel extends SimModelImpl {
  
  Normal myNormalDist;
  Uniform myUniformDist;

  ...

  public void begin() {
    MersenneTwister generator1 = new MersenneTwister(123);
    MersenneTwister generator2 = new MersenneTwister(321);

    myNormalDist = new Normal(1.0, 1.0, generator1);
    myUniformDist = new Uniform(generator2);
  }

  ...

  public void someMethod() {
    int index = myUniformDist.nextIntFromTo(0, 10);
    doubl val = myNormalDist.nextDouble();
 }
}

</pre></code>
The important part here is the creation of two different 
MersenneTwisters. This will provide two different random number
streams to the distributions. You can parameterize the seeds
to these distributions and make them available to be set via the 
user interface or through a parameter file, by providing get
and set methods for two seed values. You would then use the seed variables
to seed the MersenneTwisters in place of "123" and "321" above.

If the seeds are user specifiable, its also important to create 
the distributions in the begin() method rather than the setup() method. 
Any parameter changes will occur after setup() has been called and
so creating your distributions there will ignore any parameter changes.<p>
