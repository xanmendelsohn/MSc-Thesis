<a name="main_model">
<h3><li>How do I make my model the "main" executable class?</h3>
Executable classes in java, that is classes that can be run from
the command line with <code>java MyClass.class</code> to start an
application, must implement the main method. The main method has
the following signature <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>.
If you wish your model to be executable then you need to implement this
method in your code. The method itself will look something like:

<code><pre>
public static void main(String[] args) {
  SimInit init = new SimInit();
  HeatBugsModel model = new HeatBugsModel();
  init.loadModel(model, null, false);      
}
</pre></code>  

This code creates an instance of the SimInit class (the same class
with which you can load your models on the command line), and instance
of the model itself. It then uses SimInit to load the model via the
loadModel method. The second and third parameters of the loadModel method
specify a parameter file and whether or not the model is a batch
model. You can either pass values to these parameters via the args
array or if you know that this model is a batch model, you can
specify the method parameters directly. The following is an 
example of the later.

<code><pre>
public static void main(String[] args) {
  SimInit init = new SimInit();
  EnnBatchModel model = new EnnBatchModel();
  init.loadModel(model, "./EnnParams.txt", true);      
}
</pre></code> 

This code snippet is from EnnBatchModel.java in the enn demo 
(see repast/demo/enn). Here we create an instance of SimInit and
the model as above. We then pass a parameter file path and a value
of true to the second and third arguments of the loadModel method. 
With these parameters SimInit would load EnnBatchModel in batch mode, 
and read the parameters from the EnnParams.txt file.<p>

If you wish to parse the arguments in the args parameter of the 
main method and pass them to the loadModel, the following shoudl help. 
For a command line of:

<code><pre>
java -cp c:\repast\lib\repast.jar;. MyModel param.pf true
</pre></code>

args[0] = param.pf and args[1] = true. And knowing this it should not
be hard to parse args[] and extract the appropriate values to pass
to the loadModel method.

<a name="run_jar">
<h3><li>How do I make my jar files executable?</h3>
See answer to item 4.
<h3><li>How can start my model with 'java -jar mymodel.jar'?</h3>
See answer to item 4
<h3><li>How can I start my model by clicking on it (i.e. how can I make it  
behave like other windows applications)?</h3>

To do this you must create your own manifest file and then use this
manifest file when you create your jar file. A manifest file is simply
a plain text file with some special tags that the Java virtual machine
knows how to work with. You can include special tags in the mainfest
file that tell the Java virtual machine which file in that jar file is
the executable "main" class, as well as specifying a classpath. As of
Repast 1.3 all the demonstration simulations are run in this way. The
following is the manifest file from bugs.jar (the heatbugs demo
simulation).

<code><pre>
Main-Class: uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel
Class-Path: ../../lib/repast.jar ../../lib/trove.jar ../../lib/colt.jar 
../../lib/jgl3.1.0.jar ../../lib/excelaccessor_Runtime.jar ../../lib/jmf.jar 
../../lib/jcchart.jar ../../lib/junit.jar ../../lib/plot.jar 
../../lib/xerces.jar
</pre></code>

The <code>Class-Path:</code> entries should all be one line.
Here the main class is uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel and it 
requires the specified classpath in order to execute correctly. The class
path is space delimited here, and the paths of the jar files are defined
relative to the bugs.jar file. In this case two directories above the
repast/demo/bugs directory in the repast/lib directory. With this 
manifest file in the bugs.jar archive, we execute the heatbugs simulation
with <code>java -jar bugs.jar</code>. This has the added benefit
of making the jar file executable when double click under windows.
Given the above manifest file, this is directly equivalent to:

<code><pre>
java -cp  ./bugs.jar;../../lib/repast.jar;../../lib/trove.jar;
../../lib/colt.jar; ../../lib/jgl3.1.0.jar;
../../lib/excelaccessor_Runtime.jar;../../lib/jmf.jar;
../../lib/jcchart.jar;../../lib/junit.jar;../../lib/plot.jar;
../../lib/xerces.jar uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel
</pre></code>

(Note that as of Repast v.1.3, you no longer start models this way.
repast.jar itself contains a manifest file that specifies a classpath
containing all the other required jar files. So instead of the above,
you can do <code>java -cp  ./bugs.jar;../../lib/repast.jar 
uchicago.src.sim.heatBugs.HeatBugsModel</code>.)<p>

Once you've written your manifest file, you need to include it 
in your jar. If you haven't yet created your jar file, you can
do this all in one step with the 'jar' utility that comes with
the java development kit.

<code><pre>
jar cfvm my_model.jar mymanifest my_model_dir
</pre></code>

where my_model.jar is the name of the jar file you are creating, 
mymanifest is the manifest file you've created and my_model_dir
is the directory for your actual model. So for heatbugs this
looks like:

<code><pre>
jar cfvm bugs.jar bugs_manifest uchicago/src/sim/heatBugs
</pre></code>

If your model is in a package (as it should be) its important to jar
it from the directory above the first package directory. In the heatbugs
case I would run the jar command from the directory in which the 
uchicago directory resided.<p>

If you already have your classes in a jar file and just want to 
add the manifest file, replace the 'c' in the above command with a
'u'. 
<p>


You can inspect the contents of your jar file with <code>jar -tf 
name_of_jar_file</code>. Your manifest won't be included in the jar 
itself as its contents are actually copied  into the MANIFEST.MF file.

<a name="stop_pause"></p>
<li><h3>How do I stop or pause my model from within the model</h3>
As of Repast 1.3, SimModelImpl (and thus all models that inherit from
it) implements two new methods: <code>public void stop()</code> and
<code>public void pause</code>. You can call these methods from within
the model to stop or pause it. Like any other public method, this
methods are schedulable so you can schedule your model to pause (or 
stop) at particular intervals or at specified ticks. For example,

<code><pre>
int pauseTick = -1;
...
private void buildSchedule() {
  schedule.scheduleActionAt(pauseTick, this, "pause", Schedule.LAST);
  ...
}

public void setPauseTick(int val) {
  pauseTick = val;
  schedule.scheduleActionAt(pauseTick, this, "pause", Schedule.LAST);
}

public int getPauseTick() {
  return pauseTick;
}
</pre></code>

will allow you to schedule pauses through the gui.

<a name="agent_param">
<h3><li>My agents display too many parameters when probed. How can I 
limit them?</h3>

If your agent implements the <code>CustomProbeable</code> interface
only those parameters whose names are returned in the String[] from
<code>CustomProbeable.getProbedProperties()</code> will be displayed.
For example,

<code><pre>
public class MyAgent implements CustomProbeable {

  private int age;

  ...

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public void setAge(int val) {
    age = val;
  }

  public String[] getProbedProperties() {
    return new String[] {"Age"};
  }                             
}

</pre></code>             
  
When probed MyAgent classes will now only display the "Age" parameter.


<a name="add_button">
<h3><li>How do I add my own button to the Repast toolbar?</h3>
The following code demonstrates how to do this:

<code><pre>
public void setup() {
  
  ...

  Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
  c.addButton("Help", new ActionListener() {
     public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
       showHelp();
     }
  });

}
</pre></code>

Controller has three new methods for adding custom buttons to
the toolbar. Using the addButton methods you can add a JButton
directly, specify a label and an ActionListener, or specify the
path to an Icon and an ActionListener. The above code snippet
will add new a JButton with the label "Help" to the toolbar and 
call the showHelp method whenever it is clicked. You must add new 
buttons in your model's setup() method otherwise they will not 
appear in the toolbar.<p>

If you don't understand how to work with JButtons, and ActionListeners, 
you should learn a bit about the Java's Swing gui toolkit before adding 
custom buttons to the toolbar.

<a name="key">
<h3><li>I'd like my model to do X when I hit a key.  How do I do
this?</h3> 

You can perform some action in response to key events when either the
DisplaySurface, or the Controller (i.e. the Repast toolbar) has
focus. Which one you choose depends on which one is more appropriate
for your action. For example, if you wish to do something to the
display in the DisplaySurface, then you'd hook the key code up to the
DisplaySurface. In either case, the code to listen for key events is
the same. For example,

<code><pre>
Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
c.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
  public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_K) {
	    System.out.println("k key typed");
    }
  }
});
</pre></code>

will print "k key typed" to the console whenever the toolbar (i.e. the
Controller) has focus and the "k" key is pressed. To perform the same
action when a DisplaySurface has focus, you'd replace the reference to
the Controller with one to your DisplaySurface. So,

<code><pre>
myDisplaySurface.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
  public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {
    if (evt.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_K) {
	    System.out.println("k key typed");
    }
  }
});
</pre></code>

Typically you place this sort code to the setup() method in your
model. This ensures that you can listener for key events before your
simluation begins to run.

Note that KeyAdapter and KeyEvent are in the java.awt.event package,
so you'll have to import them into your model. Adding KeyListeners in
this way is standard Java and any Java book can provide more details.

<a name="button">
<h3><li>I'd like my model to do X when I click one of the
toolbar buttons. How do I do this?</h3>

By default Repast takes the appropriate action whenever you click one
of the toolbar buttons. However, you can also add your own to code to
be executed when a button is clicked. You can listen for button clicks on
the start, stop, pause, step, and exit buttons. For example,

<code><pre>
Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
c.addStartListener(new ActionListener() {
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
    System.out.println("start");
  }
});
</pre></code>

This code listens for start button clicks and prints "start" to the
console whenever a start button click occurs. Each button has its own
add listener method so addStopListener will add code for execution on
stop button clicks, addPauseListener for pause button clicks and so
on. If you wish to know which button has been clicked (assuming you've
got the same listener listening to more than one button), the button's
actionCommand reports the buttons name. For example, the code

<code><pre>
Controller c = (Controller)this.getController();
c.addStartListener(new ActionListener() {
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
    javax.swing.JButton b = (javax.swing.JButton)evt.getSource();
    System.out.println(b.getActionCommand());
  }
});
</pre></code>

will print "start", the Start button's action command, to the
console. The exit button's action command is "exit", pause is "pause"
and so on.

Adding listeners to buttons in this way is standard Java and any good
book on Java can tell you more.

<a name="text">
<h3><li>How can I write some text to the display?</h3>
If you want to display some text, e.g. some informative message or
statistic, on the display. You can use a TextDisplay. See
<a href="./display.html">How to Create Displays</a> 
  for more info, as well as the TextDisplay <A href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/TextDisplay.html"  <API< API a <A API< 
          <A href="../api/uchicago/src/sim/gui/TextDisplay.html"  <API< API a <A API< 
          <>docs.

<a name="display">
<h3><li>I'd like to make my own Display. What's the
best way to do that?</h3>
The uchicago.src.sim.gui package contains an abstract Display class
that can be used as the base class for new Display classes. See
the source for Display.java 
(repast/src/src/uchicago/src/sim/gui/Display.java) for more.


<a name="#edge_dir">
<h3><li>I've written a network model. What's that
funny square on all the edges?</h3>
The square indicates edge directionality. The square is closer to the "to"
node and farther from the "from" node. If the nodes are too close to each
other to determine directionality, you can use the mouse (click and drag)
to move the nodes further away.

<h3><li><a name="probe_update">How do I update my model or agent's probe
panel from within the model or agent?</a></h3>

Suppose you have two properties connected with each other such that
a change to implies a change to other. When you change the first
such property in a probe panel (either the agent's probe panel, or
your model's parameter panel) you'd like the panel to update and
display the concommitant change in the second property.<p>

You can update an Object's probe panel using
<tt>ProbeUtilities.updateProbePanel(Object object)</tt> method. The
object here is the object whose probe panel you wish to update. So,
for example, we could implement the above scenario where a change to
parameter X, changed the value of parameter y and we want the
parameter (probe) window to display the new value of y, as follows:

<code><pre>
public void setX(int val) {
  x = val;
  setY(val / 2);
  ProbeUtilities.updateProbePanel(this);
}

public void setY(int val) {
  y = val;
}

...

</pre></code>

This is also useful for turning various exclusive boolean switches on
and off in response to others being set on.<p>

See the API documentation for the ProbeUtilities class for more.

<h3><li><a name="probe_update_2">I'd like my probes to update 
every iteration of the model. How do I do that?</a></h3>

The context here is that you are running your model in gui mode and that
you are probing your agents such that their properties are displayed
in a probe window. You'd like these properties to update every tick
of the model.

This can be done both via the GUI and in code. To turn this on via the
gui, switch to the Repast actions tab panel and click on Update Probes. 
To do this in code, you set the UPDATE_PROBES flag in Controller to true.
For example, 
<code><pre>
Controller.UPDATE_PROBES = true;
</pre></code>

This will update all probes except for that on the model. To update 
the model probe, you'll have to call 
<tt>ProbeUtilities.updateModelProbePanel</tt>. Updating the model's probe
is computationally expensive.<p>

Note that updating probes will slow down your model although
considerably less in java 1.4 vs. previous version of java.


<h3><li><a name="#console">I'd like turn the Repast Console on or off.
How do I do that?</a></h3>

Stdout (output written to <code>System.out</code>) and stderr (errors 
written to <code>System.err</code>) can be redirected to The Repast Console.

The Repast Console can be turned on or off via the GUI and in code. To turn
it on/off via the GUI, switch to the Repast actions tab panel and click on 
"Stdout to Console" or "Stderr to Console" to either one on or off. Note that 
if they are both off then the Repast Console will not appear.

To do this in code, you need to set the flags AbstractGUIController.CONSOLE_OUT 
and AbstractGUIController.CONSOLE_ERR. For example,<p>

<code><pre>
AbstractGUIController.CONSOLE_ERR = false;
AbstractGUIController.CONSOLE_OUT = false;
</pre></code>You can do this in the constructor of your model.
