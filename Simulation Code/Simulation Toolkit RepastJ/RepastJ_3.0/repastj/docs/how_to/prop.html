<center>How to Create PropertyDescriptors</center> </h1><p>
PropertyDescriptors allows the manipulation of a model's properties
(also called parameters) via gui widgets displayed on the parameter's
tab pane.  You can also use PropertyDescriptors in conjunction with an
agent's parameters. More on that at the end of this document.  Repast
has three kinds of PropertyDescriptors: a descriptor for boolean
properties which are displayed as a check box; a descriptor for
properties whose possible values can be expressed as a list (a
neighborhood parameter whose possible values are Von Neumann or Moore,
for example); and a descriptor for numerical integer ranges. Just like
the parameters displayed by default in a text box, boolean, list and
range propery descriptors depend on the get and set accessor method
pattern. In fact, when creating PropertyDescriptor objects, the
PropertyDescriptor is passed the name of the property in its
constructor.  The name of this property must be reflected in the model
as a get and set method. So for example, if the property is "Age", the
model must have a getAge and setAge method.<p>

<b>BooleanPropertyDescriptor</b><p>

A BooleanPropertyDescriptor is typically setup in a model's constructor
as follows:
<code><pre>
BooleanPropertyDescriptor bd1 = new BooleanPropertyDescriptor("RecordData", 
                                                             false);
descriptors.put("RecordData", bd1);
</pre></code>
<p>
This property descriptor describes the RecordData property/parameter of
some model, and thus assumes that the model contains a setRecordData
and a getRecordData (or a isRecordData method in place of the getRecordData). 
A BooleanPropertyDescriptor's
constructor takes the name of the boolean property, and the default state
of that property, in this case false. The BooleanPropertyDescriptor is then
placed in the hashtable "descriptors" (an ivar of the SimModelImpl class,
and so available to any model that extends SimModelImpl).
When the model parameters are displayed in gui mode, the RecordData
parameter will then be displayed as a check box. For more information 
see the API documentation for 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/reflector/BooleanPropertyDescriptor.html">BooleanPropertyDescriptor</a>

<b>Note that as of Repast 1.3 boolean (or Boolean) properties are now
displayed as checkboxes by default. You no longer need to create your
own BooleanPropertyDescriptors</b>
<p>

<b>ListPropertyDescriptor</b><p>
A ListPropertyDescriptor is a PropertyDescriptor for a parameter whose
possible values can be constrained to a list. This list is represented in
the parameters tab panel as combo box. Selecting an item from the 
combo box calls the appropriate set method passing the selected item
as an argument. The list of possible values can be passed to a
ListPropertyDescriptor as a Vector or an array of Objects. For example:
<code><pre>
Vector v = new Vector();
v.add("VON NEUMANN");
v.add("MOORE");
ListPropertyDescriptor pd = new ListPropertyDescriptor("NType", v);
descriptors.put("NType", pd);
</pre></code>

The combo box associated with this ListPropertyDescriptor will 
display two items: "VON NEUMANN", and "MOORE". 'NType' indicates 
that these items are possible values for the 'NType' model parameter.
When the user selects one of these two items from the combo box, the 
selected Object (a String with a value of "VON NEUMANN", or "MOORE")
is passed as an argument to the setNType method.<p>

A ListPropertyDescriptor can also be used to display such things as
numerical constants as Strings by passing a hashtable in
the constructor of the ListPropertyDescriptor. For example:
<code><pre>
Hashtable h1 = new Hashtable();
h1.put(new Integer(0), "VON NEUMANN");
h1.put(new Integer(1), "MOORE");
ListPropertyDescriptor pd = new ListPropertyDescriptor("NType", h1);
descriptors.put("NType", pd);
</pre></code>

Here a ListPropertyDescriptor is created with the name of the property, and a
hashtable as an argument. The second argument is a hashtable
whose keys are the actual objects that can be selected and passed to the
set method and whose values are the string representations of those objects.
In the above case, the hashtable contains two keys: an Integer with a value
of 0 and an Integer with a value of 1. The value of these two keys' are
the Strings "VON NEUMANN" and "MOORE" respectively. What the user will see
then is a combo box labeled as "NType" that contains two Strings "VON
NEUMANN" and "MOORE". When the user selects one of these strings, the
corresponding Integer is passed as an argument to the setNType method.
Note that setNType can take an int argument as the probing mechanism
here automatically converts between an Integer and an int.
Descriptors is an instance variable (a hashtable) of the SimModelImpl class
and can be used by sub classes. For more information see the API docs
for 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/reflector/ListPropertyDescriptor.html">ListPropertyDescriptor</a>
<p>

<b>RangePropertyDescriptor</b><p>

A RangePropertyDescriptor is a descriptor for a parameter / property
whose value can be expressed as falling within a range of integer
values. It is useful when you want to restrict user input to some
value within a range of integers. The range is represented in the gui
by a slider with minimum and maximum values and a text box into which
you can type some specific value. If the value you enter is greater
than the maximum allowable value or less than the minimum value the
actual value will be set to the maximum or minimum
respectively. Similarly, if you enter a non-numerical value into the
text box the value will default to the most recent valid
value. Selecting an integer from within the range either via the
slider or the text box calls the appropriate set method in your
model.<p>

Assuming your model has a property called "numAgents" that is
represented by an integer. You can tie this property to a
RangePropertyDescriptor as follows:

<code><pre>
RangePropertyDescriptor d = new RangePropertyDescriptor("numAgents", 
                                                       10, 100, 20);
descriptors.put("numAgents", d);
</pre></code>

The first parameter to the RangePropertyDescriptor constructor is the
name of the property, the second is the minimum values, followed by
the maximum value and then the tick spacing. The tick spacing
parameter determines the display of intermediate values in the
slider. For example, a range of 10 - 100 and a tick spacing of 10 will
display ticks on the slider for 20, 30, 40 and so on up to 90. Note that
this only determines the display, any integer value between 10 - 100
can be selected. For more information see the API docs for 
<a href="../api/uchicago/src/reflector/RangePropertyDescriptor.html">RangePropertyDescriptor</a>
<p>


<h3>Using PropertyDescriptors in Agent classes</h3>
Its quite easy to use PropertyDescriptors in agent classes. When coded
properly the appropriate checkbox (for boolean properties) or combobox will 
appear when the agent is probed (i.e. double clicked). The behavoir of 
these widgets is identical to those that appear a model's parameter pane.<p>

The code for your agent to use PropertyDescriptors is nearly identical to
the necessary code for using PropertyDescriptors in your model with two
important exceptions. A model that inherits from SimModelImpl 
automatically inherits the Hashtable instance variable called descriptors.
(This variable was mentioned and used in the code above). An agent
class will not have this variable and will need to create it. Similarly,
any model that inherits from SimModelImpl also inherits the 
<code>DescriptorContainer</code> interface. If your agent class doesn't
already implement this inteface (unlikely), it will need to. 
Fortunately, this interface has a single method 
<code>public Hashtable getParameterDescriptors()</code> that would
return the descriptors hashtable mentioned above.<p>

The minimum amount of code necessary for an agent to use 
PropertyDescriptors follows:

<code><pre>
public class MyAgent implements DescriptorContainer {
  
  private Hashtable descriptors = new Hashtable();

  public Hashtable getParameterDescriptors() {
    return descriptors;
  } 

}
</pre></code>

Actually creating the PropertyDescriptors and adding them to the 
descriptors Hashtable is identical for both models and agents, and
the instructions in the first part of this document can be used for
both cases.
