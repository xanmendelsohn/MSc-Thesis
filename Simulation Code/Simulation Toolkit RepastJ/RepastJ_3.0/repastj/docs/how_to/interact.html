<p>A user can interact with a non-batch Repast simulation 
through the gui. The gui allows the user to start, stop, pause, setup, and exit 
a simulation through the toolbar. The table below lists the toolbar buttons and 
their functions.

<ol>
  <li><STRONG>Start 
  Multi-Run</STRONG>: The start multi-run button starts a batch run of a 
  simulation. See <A href="./multirun.html" >How to Use the Multi-Run</A> for more details. 

  <LI><B>Start</B>: The start button 
  starts the simulation when it is paused or has not yet been started, iterating 
  through the scheduled behavior. 
  <li><b>Step</B>: The step button 
  starts the simulation when it is paused or has not yet been started, iterating 
  through a single iteration the scheduled behavior. 
  <li><b>Initialize</B>: The 
  initialize button starts the simulation but pauses before iterating any 
  scheduled behavior. Only the initializing code is executed in this case. 
  <li><b>Stop</B>: The stop button 
  stops the simulation. 
  <li><b>Pause</B>: The pause button 
  pauses the simulation. 
  <li><b>Setup</B>: The setup button 
  "sets up" the simulation by executing the user defined setup code. 
  <li><b>Load Model</B>: The load 
  model button pops up a dialog allowing the user to specify a model to load. 
  <li><b>View Settings</B>: The view 
  settings button will display the various model settings panel if it is hidden 
  or destroyed. 
  <li><b>Exit</B>: The exit button 
  will shutdown the simulation and exit. </LI></OL>To run a simulation you would 
click either the start, step or initialize buttons. If you click the initialize 
button, you would then click step or start. When you want to stop the simulation 
and then run it again, you click stop and then the setup button. 
<p>In addition, if the model has followed the get/set 
method pattern (see <A href="./model.html#getset" >How to Build a 
Model</A> and <A href="./params.html" >How to use Parameters and Parameter Files</A>) the user 
will also be able to see and set the initial parameters of a simulation. The 
initial parameters will appear in the settings window on the tab entitled 
"Parameters" into which the user can see the default starting parameters and 
enter new ones. 
<p>Also in the settings window are the Custom Actions tab 
and the Repast Actions tab. The Custom Actions tab will contain any sliders, 
buttons, or checkboxes that the simulation author has defined. You can interact 
with the model while it is running through these sliders, buttons, and 
checkboxes. 
<p>The Repast Actions tab looks like: 
<p><center><IMG src="./images/repastactions.png" ></center>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The first two buttons allow you to make a movie or 
  take a snapshot. Clicking on one of these buttons will bring up a dialog 
  containing further information and choices. 
  <li>The third button will bring up a dialog for creating 
  an sequence chart. (This functionality is provisional at this time.) 
  <li>The "In Alpha Order" check box controls the order of 
  the parameters in the parameters tab. If it is checked the parameters will 
  appear in alphabetical order. Otherwise they will appear in the order they are 
  defined in the model. 
  <LI>The "Stdout to Console" check box determines if standard output (output 
  from "System.out.println") will be captured by the Repast console.
  <LI>The "Stderr to Console" check box determines if standard error (output 
  from "System.err.println") will be captured by the Repast console.
  <li> The "RngSeed in Defaults" checkbox determines 
  whether the current random number seed will be included as a default value 
  either when written to a file or set as the current default. 
  <li>"Update Probes" determines whether or not any probed 
  objects have their displayed properties updated in real-time or not. 
  <li>"Show custom charts" determines whether or not any 
  custom charts created for this model using the "create / edit charts" button 
  are automatically created and displayed when this model is run. 
  <li> The "Set As Default" button will set the current
parameters as the default until Repast is exited. This
means that whenever the setup button is pressed these new
defaults will be used rather the initial parameters. 

<li> The "Write Parameters" button will write the current parameters
to a file so that can be loaded later.

<li> The "About" button displays a typical about dialog 
  giving some further information about Repast.</li></UL>

 
A user may also probe objects in the simulation provided those objects
implement the get/set method pattern and whose displays are added to
the DisplaySurface as probeables (see <a href="./display.html">How to
Create Displays</a>). To probe an object, pause the simulation, and
left click on the object in the display. The probeable state of all
the objects underneath the cursor should appear in windows similar to
the "Parameters" tab in the settings window, and their properties can
be set in the same way (i.e. changing the property and pressing
enter).<p>

Displaying a simulation can be one of the slowest parts 
of a simulation. Repast will not update the display if the display window is 
minimized, allowing for dynamic display updates. (Of course, these kind of 
updates can be set explicitly through a Schedule.) When the window is displayed 
again it will update in the usual manner.</p>
