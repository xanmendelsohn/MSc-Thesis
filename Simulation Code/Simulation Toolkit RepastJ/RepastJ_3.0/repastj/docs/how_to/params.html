<b>Parameter Overview</b><br>
A parameter is a property of a model whose initial value is used to 
create the actual model. It defines an initial model condition. 
Typically, you use these parameters to build the rest of your model.
For example, the parameter NumAgents might specify the initial number
of agents a model should contain. The value of these parameters can
be retrieved and set by the user via the Repast user interface or 
automatically through a parameter file. However, for this to work
your model must follow some simple coding conventions.

<ul>
<li> The parameter names must be in the String array returned
by your models getInitParam() method. For example,
<code><pre>
public String[] getInitParam() {
    String[] params = {"evapRate", "diffusionConstant", "maxIdealTemp",
          "minIdealTemp", "maxOutputHeat", "minOutputHeat", "worldXSize",
          "worldYSize", "numBugs"};
    return params;
}     
</pre></code>
These ("evapRate", etc.) are the parameters for this model.
</li><p>

<li> The parameters must have associated get and/or set methods. If
both are present the parameter is readable and writable, if only the
get method is present the parameter is read-only. Get and set method
are methods whose name is "get" or "set" followed by the parameter
name. For example, given the above set of parameters, 
the model must then contain methods such as
<code><pre>
public void setEvapRate(double rate) {
  eRate = rate;
}

public double getEvapRate() {
  return eRate;
}
</pre></code>
and so on for the rest of the parameters. All access to the parameters
is through these methods and any actual variables that represent the 
parameters (such as eRate in the above example) remain hidden. </li></ul><p>

Many of the Repast data collection mechanisms rely on these parameters
remaining constant throughout the life time of a run once the model begins
to run. This does not preclude in any way changing the parameters via
the user interface or parameter files, but only that these parameters are
not expected to change once the model is actually running. 

Once the parameters are defined in this way, they can be changed
through the user interface or through parameter files.<p> 

<a name="file">
<b>Parameter Files</b><br>
Parameter files can be used with both gui and batch models. For 
gui models, the parameter file sets some or all initial parameter values,
as if the user had entered those values by hand. 
For a batch model, a parameter file defines a parameter space and 
describes how the model should explore that space. 

A parameter file has the following format: <pre><code>
runs: x
Parameter {
 value_definition
}
</code></pre>
where x is some number and Parameter is the name of some model parameter
accessible through get and set methods. Runs specifies the number of runs
to execute for the current parameter value. "runs:" is ignored for
non-batch models. The value_definition is composed
of one or more keywords and corresponding values.<p>

The multi-keyword value definitions:

<ul>
<li> "start:" the starting numerical value of a parameter.</li>
<li> "end:" the ending numerical value of a parameter.</li>
<li> "incr:" the amount to increment the current value of the parameter.</li>
</ul>
The start, end, and incr keywords together provide a value defintion and
must always occur together. For a batch simulation they define
a parameter space which will be automatically iterated through. start:
defines the initial parameter. end: the parameter up to and including
ending parameter, and incr: the amount to increment the start: value and
any succeeding values to reach the end: parameters. For a gui simulation
the start: value is taken as the default parameter and the remaining
keywords are ignored.<p>
 
Single keyword value_definitions:
<ul>
<li> "set:" defines a single numerical value as a constant 
for the entire collection of batch runs.</li>
<li> "set_list:" defines a space separated list of numerical values. A batch
simluation will iterate through the list.</li>
<li> "set_boolean:" defines a boolean value as a constant for the entire batch
simulation. Allowed values are "true" and "false" (without the quotes).</li>
<li> "set_string:" defines a string value as a constant for the entire batch
simluation. The string value must not contain any white space.</li>
<li> "set_boolean_list:" same as set_list but a list of boolean values (true
or false).</li>
<li> "set_string_list:" same as set_list but a list of string values.</li>
</ul>
For non-batch models the list keywords are equivalent to the "set:" 
keywords where the value is the first member of the list.<p>

Some examples,
<pre><code>
runs: 10
Food {
 start: 10
 end: 30
 incr: 10
}
</code></pre>
This means start with a food parameter with a value  of 10 and 
run the simulation 10 times
using this value. Increment the food value by 10 and run the simulation 10
times with a food value of 20 (start 10 + incr 10). Increment the food value
by another 10, and run another 10 times with the food value of 30 (start 10 +
incr 10 + incr 10). Incrementing the current value at this point
would result in a value greater than the ending value and so the
simulation ends.<p>

More than one parameter can be specified, so for example,
<pre><code>
runs: 10
Food {
 start: 10
 end: 30
 incr: 10
}

MaxAge {
 start: 10
 end: 30
 incr: 10
}
</code></pre>
Where both food and max age are incremented as described above. If using more
than one parameter it is important to synchronize them, as whenever any
parameter's current value is greater than its end value, the simulation will
exit.<p>

Parameters can also be nested. For example,
<pre><code>
runs: 1
Food {
 start: 10
 end: 30
 incr: 10
 {
   runs: 10
   MaxAge {
     start: 0
     end: 40
     incr: 1
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>
This example means starting with a food value of 10 run the simulation 10
times with a MaxAge of 0. Increment MaxAge by 1 and run the simulation 10
times, continue until the value of MaxAge is greater than 40. At this point,
increment Food by 10 and run the simulation 10 times with a MaxAge of 0.
Increment MaxAge by 1 and run the simulation 10 times. This continues until
the value of Food is greater than 30. Multiple levels of nesting are possible.
<p>
 
Setting constants:
<pre><code>
runs: 1
Food {
 start: 10
 end: 30
 incr: 10
 {
   runs: 10
   MaxAge {
     start: 0
     end: 40
     incr: 1
   }
 }
}
RngSeed {
 set: 1
}
</code></pre>
RngSeed is parameter of every model and can be manipulated like any other
parameter. And here it is set to one and this value will remain constant
over all the individual batch runs.<p>

List parameters:
 <pre><code>
runs: 1
Food {
 start: 10
 end: 30
 incr: 10
 {
   runs: 10
   MaxAge {
     set_list: 1.2 3 10 12 84
   }
 }
}
RngSeed {
 set: 1
}
</code></pre>
This is the same as above except that maxAge will be incremented via the list.
So first run with maxAge as 1.2, do this for 10 runs. Then set maxAge to 3 and
run with this value for 10 times. Continue until the end of the list, then
increment Food and start at the beginning of the MaxAge list, and so on
until the Food parameter is greater than 30.<p>

The boolean and string keywords work in an identical manner, but set boolean
and string values instead of numeric ones.<p>

Parameter files can contain comments delimited by the standard c/c++/java
comment markers: '//', '/*...*/'<p>
