This document describes how to use the "Multi-Run" capabilities in 
Repast. This includes the Multi-Run button on the Repast toolbar, and the 
Parameter Wizard. 
<p><a name="overview"></a><b>Overview</b><br>Repast has previously 
included support for performing batch simulation runs. This is useful when you 
want to run a simulation without the extra burden of graphical displays or when 
you have a large set of parameters you wish to run your model against (More 
information on this is available in <A href="./params.html" >How to Use Parameters and 
Parameter files</A>). New in Repast 3 is the capability to build parameter files 
through a graphical wizard and the ability to execute these batch runs from the 
Repast toolbar. 
<P><a name="wizard"></a><b>The Parameter Wizard</b><br>The 
Parameter wizard automatically searches a model for the parameters available. It 
will load the parameters from the model's getInitParam(). Once they are loaded 
you can choose how the parameter will be fed through into the model. You have 
the choice of the parameter being a single constant value, an incremented value 
(starting at some value, incrementing by another value, and continuing until it 
has hit a final value), or a list of values. 
<p>

<p>You can get to the Parameter wizard in two ways, one by 
choosing a model through the Load Model dialog (available through the Open 
button on the toolbar <IMG src="./images/Open24.gif" align="absMiddle" >); the other through 
the Multi-Run button on the toolbar <IMG alt="Multi-Run button" src="images/ParameterSweep.gif" align="absMiddle" >.</p>
<P><a name="button"></a><b>The Multi-Run Button</b><br>The 
Multi-Run button is used to start a set of batch runs on a model through the 
Repast toolbar.&nbsp; When you have a model loaded you can click on the 
Multi-Run button and you will be prompted to choose a parameter file.

<p>If you do not have a previously generated parameter 
file, by choosing cancel you will be notified that you must choose a parameter 
file and you then will be returned to the now expanded Repast toolbar.
<p>

<p>Now by clicking on the combo box on the toolbar that 
currently says "&lt;Browse...&gt;" you can either choose to again browse for a 
parameter file or you can choose "&lt;Create...&gt;" which will take you to the 
parameter wizard.
<P>Once you have selected (or created) a parameter file, you then can execute 
the model on it by clicking the Multi-Run button.
<P><a name="runwalkthrough"></a><b>A Multi-Run</b><br>
Once you have your parameter file selected, you can then click on the Multi-Run button.  This will start the model
in batch mode.  The "Tick Count" label will update according to the current tick of the model and the Run count 
label will update according to which run the model is on (a run is started every time the model stops).<br>

<P><a name="notes"></a><b>Multi-Run Notes</b><br>
For a run to 
end the model must in some way end. This can happen through a call to 
super.stop() from inside a SimModel or by calling stopSim() on the current 
controller. Also, the model still must handle being in batch mode by itself. 
This means, if you do not wish for displays and graphs and other GUI elements of 
your model to display, you must disable them yourself. A simple way to do this 
is to have a DisplayGUI parameter in your model and whenever that parameter is 
set to something like 0 do not show the displays, otherwise do.</P>
