<h1>Repast 3.0</h1>

 
Repast 3.0 has a variety of features including the following:
<ul>
        <li>Repast includes a variety of agent templates and examples. However, the toolkit gives users complete flexibility as to how they specify the properties and behaviors of agents.</li>

        <li>Repast is fully object-oriented.</li>

        <li>Repast includes a fully concurrent discrete event scheduler. This scheduler supports both sequential and parallel discrete event operations.</li>

        <li>Repast offers built-in simulation results logging and graphing tools.</li>

        <li>Repast has automated Monte Carlo simulation framework.</li>

        <li>Repast provides a range of two-dimensional agent environments and visualizations.</li>

        <li>Repast allows users to dynamically access and modify agent properties, agent behavioral equations, and model properties at run time.</li>

        <li>Repast includes libraries for genetic algorithms, neural networks, random number generation, and specialized mathematics.</li>

        <li>Repast includes built-in systems dynamics modeling.</li>

        <li>Repast has social network modeling support tools.</li>

        <li>Repast has integrated geographical information systems (GIS) support.</li>

        <li>Repast is fully implemented in a variety of languages including Java and C#.</li>

        <li>Repast models can be developed in many languages including Java, C#, Managed C++, Visual Baisc.Net, Managed Lisp, Managed Prolog, and Python scripting.</li>

        <li>Repast is available on virtually all modern computing platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The platform support includes both personal computers and large-scale scientific computing clusters.</li>
